# Your-Favorite-Games-done-terribly
The title says it all

But if you want to learn more... Thanks? I guess.

So, I've been on a journey for the past couple of years. I like video games; love them, actually. But recently I havent had the time to play video games cause... life.
Then I told myself, "Oh, what if I make the video games myself and THEN play them?"
Pretty easy right? Well, easier said than done. Yes, the games will play terribly. And yes, the code might look like something a 10 year old would chew up in 4 hours. But this repo will show you my journey and of course, the product. I will keep updating stuff but for now, I want to add many different kinds of games. Just so it forces me to think about different things instead of focusing on the same concept.

Anywho, as for technical stuff, this is all done in processing and I'm learning it as we go. Cheers.
